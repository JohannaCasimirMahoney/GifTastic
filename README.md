# GifTastic

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

Users may click on one of the buttons labeled with the title of a TinyToon cartoon character to view ten relevant GIFs from GIPHY. 

The program initially displays the GIFs as still images and as ainmated.
