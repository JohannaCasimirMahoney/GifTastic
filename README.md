# TinyToons GifTastic

### Overview

In this assignment, I use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the users choice. The users may click on one of the buttons labeled with the title of a TinyToon cartoon character to view 10 relevant GIFs from GIPHY. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing. Under every gif, display a rating will pop up.(PG, G, so on).
